Proof by contradiction is often used to show that a language is not regular: let P a property true for all regular languages, if your specific language does not verify P, then it's not regular. The following properties can be used: The pumping lemma; Closure properties of regular languages, that is, set operations, concatenation, Kleene star, mirror, homomorphisms; A regular language has a finite number of prefix equivalence class, Myhill Nerode theorem.

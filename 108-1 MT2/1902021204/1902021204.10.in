The university has been occupied by hundreds of protesters, including many high school students, since last week. On Sunday it was the scene of some of the most intense fighting since anti government demonstrations began five months ago, as protesters fought back police attempts to enter the campus using a variety of improvised weaponry, including crude homemade napalm, bows and arrows and at least one large slingshot. The university remains sealed off by police, who have installed a tight security cordon and issued instructions to those inside to drop their weapons and turn themselves in. The mood on the campus was somber Tuesday, but far less tense, as a sense of defeat spread among those remaining. Throughout the morning, dozens of protesters surrendered to police, several in tears, as others vowed to fight on but with little idea of how to do so. university university university university university university apple apple apple apple apple apple apple apple

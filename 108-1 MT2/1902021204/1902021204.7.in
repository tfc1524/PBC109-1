This may come with a numerical score indicating how confident the computer is that the face it sees looks like one gender or the other.

There is also the question of how well the technology works when it encounters pictures of people that identify themselves differently than the software might. As Morgan Klaus Scheuerman, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, found in a recent study, facial analysis systems from major tech companies were all markedly worse at determining gender when confronted with images Of people who are trans. a  a? ?  ?   ?    ?     ?    ?    ?  ?

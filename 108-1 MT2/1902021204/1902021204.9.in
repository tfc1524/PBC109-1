The two nine ninth episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on October two, two thousand nineteen. The episode parodies media censorship in China, and the manner in which the American entertainment industry purposefully compromises its productions to avoid it. As a result of the episode criticism of its practices, the Chinese government banned the series  entirely  in  the  country,  a  move  which  in  turn  drew  criticism  from  the  creators  of  the  show. china  china  china  china  china  china  china  china  china  china  china  china  china
